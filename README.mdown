Core Data bit me
================

NSConference 2012 talk by Frédéric Sagnes, teapot apps.

Here you will find the slides and the transcript of my talk, along with all the material I used:

* open and run `CoreData.xcodeproj` to run the benchmarks
* run `generate-log.sh` to generate the SQLite dump of a single broadcast import
* have a look at `Results.numbers` if you want to see the raw numbers
